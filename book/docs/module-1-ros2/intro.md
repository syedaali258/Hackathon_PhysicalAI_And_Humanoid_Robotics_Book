# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

Welcome to the first module of our AI-native book on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics. In this module, we'll explore the fundamental concepts of ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2), which serves as the "nervous system" for robotic systems.

## What You'll Learn

In this module, you will:

- Understand the core concepts of ROS 2 including nodes, topics, and services
- Learn how to connect Python agents to ROS controllers
- Explore how to read and modify URDF files for humanoid robot modeling
- Gain hands-on experience with ROS 2 communication patterns

## Why ROS 2?

ROS 2 is the current generation of the Robot Operating System, designed to address the needs of production robotic systems. It provides:

- **Distributed Architecture**: Components can run on different machines
- **Real-time Capabilities**: Support for time-critical applications
- **Security Features**: Authentication and encryption for secure communication
- **Quality of Service**: Configurable communication patterns for different needs

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:

- Basic understanding of Python programming
- Familiarity with command-line tools
- Understanding of basic robotics concepts (optional but helpful)

## Module Structure

This module is divided into three chapters:

1. **Chapter 1: ROS 2 Fundamentals** - Learn about nodes, topics, and services
2. **Chapter 2: Python Agents with rclpy and ROS Controllers** - Connect Python agents to ROS controllers
3. **Chapter 3: Humanoid Modeling with URDF** - Understand and modify URDF files

## Getting Started

Begin with [Chapter 1: ROS 2 Fundamentals](./chapter-1-fundamentals.md) to start your journey into the robotic nervous system.
