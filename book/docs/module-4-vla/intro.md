# Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Models

Welcome to the Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Models module! This advanced module explores the cutting-edge intersection of computer vision, natural language processing, and robotic action control.

## Overview

Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models represent a significant advancement in robotics, enabling robots to understand human language commands and execute them in real-world environments. This module will teach you how to build systems that can perceive their environment, understand natural language instructions, and execute appropriate actions.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will:

- Understand the fundamental architecture of Vision-Language-Action models
- Learn how to convert voice commands into robot actions
- Explore language-based planning with LLMs and ROS 2
- Build a complete autonomous humanoid system

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:

- Basic understanding of ROS 2 concepts (covered in Module 1)
- Familiarity with Python programming
- Basic knowledge of AI/ML concepts

## Module Structure

This module is divided into three main chapters:

1. **Voice-to-Action using Speech Recognition** - Learn how to process voice commands and convert them into robot actions
2. **Language-Based Planning with LLMs and ROS 2** - Explore how large language models can generate robot action plans
3. **Capstone: The Autonomous Humanoid** - Integrate all components into a complete autonomous system

## What You'll Build

Throughout this module, you'll develop a complete VLA system that can:

- Accept voice commands from a user
- Process the commands using language models
- Execute actions on a simulated humanoid robot
- Integrate perception, planning, and control systems

Let's begin our journey into the world of Vision-Language-Action models!
